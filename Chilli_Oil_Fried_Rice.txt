Name=Chilli Oil Fried Rice

Ingredients:
- Chilli Oil (refer to Chilli Oil Recipe)
- Refrigerated rice (fresh cooked rice works too.)
- 1 Egg
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste

Instructions: 
1. In a pan, scramble the egg with salt and pepper, then keep aside.
2. Add the chilli oil to the pan, about enough to barely cover the bottom, in my experience this was about 3-4 tablespoons. Heat this up a little till it sizzles.
3. Add the rice and egg, then toss everything to combine.
4. Serve hot.
