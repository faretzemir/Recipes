Name=Thai Green Curry Soup (Hot Thai Kitchen on YT)

This was hands down the best soup I have ever made in our kitchen.

Ingredients (Serves 3–4)

Main Ingredients:
    •    2 tbsp Thai green curry paste
    •    200g deboned chicken thighs (or tofu for a vegetarian option), sliced
    •    1 cup coconut milk
    •    ½ cup water or chicken broth
    •    1 tbsp vegetable oil
    •    1 cup mixed vegetables (e.g., eggplant, red chilies, snow peas)
    •    3–4 kaffir lime leaves, torn (optional)
    •    1 tbsp fish sauce (or soy sauce for a vegetarian version)
    •    1 tsp sugar (palm sugar preferred)
    •    1–2 Thai chilies (optional, for extra heat)
    •    1 stalk lemongrass, bruised
    •    ½ cup Thai basil leaves
    •    Juice of ½ lime (optional)
   •    salt to taste

Instructions
    1.    Sauté a small amount of the coconut milk. We want to separate the oil from the coconut milk to add extra fragrance. You will know when this happens when there will be a separation of the oil at the edges. Once this is done, dd the green curry paste and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant. 
    2.    Add protein – Add the chicken (or tofu) and cook for 1–2 minutes, stirring to coat it with the paste.
    3.    Pour in coconut milk – Stir in the rest of the coconut milk and let it simmer until the chicken is partially cooked.
    4.    Add vegetables & broth – Add the vegetables, kaffir lime leaves, and water/broth. Simmer for 5–7 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and veggies are tender.
    5.    Season – Stir in fish sauce, sugar, and Thai chilies or red chili (if using). Adjust seasoning to taste.
    6.    Finish with Thai basil & lime – Turn off the heat and mix in Thai basil leaves. Squeeze in some lime juice for extra freshness. Taste for salt, remember, this will be served with rice - so it should kick you in the face with spice and salt.
    7.    Serve – Enjoy with steamed jasmine rice!
