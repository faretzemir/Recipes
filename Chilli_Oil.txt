Name=Chilli Oil

Ingredients:
- Oil, usually I heat this up using the pan, so just enough to cover the pan. (Canola is the healthiest option)
- Maggi curry seasoning 1 packet or 1 cube 
- Garlic, minced, 2-3 cloves
- Ginger, tiny bit
- Spring Onion Whites about 1 stalk worth
- Shallots 1 large or 1.5 medium or 2 small
- Sesame Seeds 1 handful
- MSG 2 Tbsp
- Salt 2 cracks
- Pepper 5-6 cracks
- Chilli flakes 2 Tbsp
- Brown Sugar 2 Tsp (not too much - will be sweet)
- Kicap Manis 1 tsp
- (OPTIONAL) Gochujang 1 Tbsp

Instructions:
1. Dump everything into a heat proof bowl, making sure the powders are all on the bottom, cover the powder with the produce. This is so it doesn't burn the powders.
2. Heat the oil until it smokes.
3. Carefully pour the oil over the ingredients in the bowl, making sure to aim for the garlic (to get rid of the raw taste)
4. Quickly, use a spoon to stir, ensuring that the oil is cooking everything evenly.
5. Done.
