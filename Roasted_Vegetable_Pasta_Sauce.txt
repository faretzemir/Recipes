Name=Roasted Vegetable Pasta Sauce

We use this pasta sauce for a variety of different pastas altered slightly. It works well for shakshouka too, just add eggs into it on a pan. Makes about 4 servings.

Ingredients
- Tomatoes 2-3 large  or 1 can (fresh is ok, but if you wanna use canned then add it into the blender after the rest is done cooking)
- Optional, sun dried tomatoes 3 pieces
- Carrot 1, halved or quartered
- 1 large onion, quartered or halved
- 1 whole head of garlic, decapitated (just cut the top off)
- 1/2 large zucchini or Japanese cucumber
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- chilli flakes to taste (a lot will make it spicier)
- 1/2 tsp rosemary
- 1/2 tsp thyme
- or Italian herbs 1 Tbsp (Thyme, oregano, parsley) 
- salt to taste
- pepper to taste
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil or canola oil for baking

Instructions:
1. On a baking tray, spread out all the produce and then drizzle a generous amount of oil onto it. Focus a lot of the oil onto the garlic - we want it to be nice and mushy when it comes out of the oven. Cover everything generously with the spices.
2. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
3. Bake the vegetables for 15-20 minutes, until there is slight char on the edges of the vegetables.
4. Take it out of the oven and put it straight in a blender, being careful to cover the top of the blender with a kitchen towel - it's really really hot!
5. Personally, I like to reduce the sauce slightly in a pan, but you can do that later also if you're prepping this. If not, then it's done! Use this with some pasta or use it for shakshouka, just add eggs or pasta! It's very versatile.
