Name=Garlic Broccoli like Mdm Kwans

This is another side dish. SIDE DISH. SIDE DISH SIDE DISH SIDE DISH.

Ingredients:
- Broccoli (large cut)
- Garlic 2-3 cloves, minced
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste
- Sesame oil to taste
- Oil 2 tbsp

Deglaze Water
- Chicken stock cube 1/4 crushed and mixed with water and cornstarch, about 50ml altogether

Instructions:
Number 1 to 2 optional, but best practice.

Cleaning the Broccoli
1. Dunk all the broccoli into a bowl of cold water mixed with salt. Stir it around and make sure that it's clean. Do this for about 1 minute until satisfied that its clean.

Boil the Broccoli
2. Put it into a pot of hot water and bring it to a boil. Once it's boiling, pull it out and dunk it into an ice bath. This makes the broccoli softer and easier to chew, while the ice bath maintains the green color of the broccoli.

3. In a pan on low heat, heat the oil and then toss in the garlic, making sure it's unclumped from being frozen in the freezer like we usually keep it.
4. Toss in the broccoli. Don't wait too long for the garlic otherwise it will burn. Don't worry about undercooking - we boiled the broccoli already.
5. Once the broccoli has been sufficiently coated in garlic, pour in the deglazing liquid, stir until the liquid has slightly thickened.
6. Take off the heat, pour on sesame oil and serve.

Sometimes I like to use oyster sauce instead of chicken stock cubes. Can also like this - you still need to add water to deglaze the pan though.
