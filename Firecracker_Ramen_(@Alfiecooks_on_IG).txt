I edited the toppings a bit - Faretz

Ingredients:
- Garlic 2-3 cloves, minced
- Ginger teeny tiny bit, minced
- Spring onion whites 1 stalk
- Chopped red chili
- Gochujang paste
- Vinegar
- soy sauce
- turmeric
- black pepper 3 cracks
- 2 chicken stock cubes mixed with whole measuring jug of water
- Coconut milk 250ml
- oil
- Mushrooms; shiittake, eryngi, whatever fungi you have
- Broccoli or bok choy
- Sesame seeds
- Lime juice
- sugar to taste
- salt to taste


Instructions:
1. Crush your garlic, grate the ginger, and finely chop the chilli + spring onion whites.
In a large saucepan, warm the oil on a medium heat.
2. Add the spring onion, followed by the chilli, ginger + garlic. Season with a pinch of salt, and sauté for a couple of minutes until fragrant.
3. Add the gochujang paste, vinegar + soy sauce, stirring well to combine. I add 1tsp of turmeric here too with a crack of black pepper.
4. Prepare your broth by mixing together 2 stock cubes + boiling water. Add to the broth base, followed by coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 10-15 minutes.
5. Whilst the broth simmers, heat 1tbsp of oil in a frying pan a high heat, then sauté the mushrooms for 5 minutes on each side until golden + crisp (weigh down with a pan or spatula for best texture).
6. Cut the broccoli into florets, then steam or parboil (you still want a crunch). For bok choy, blanch in salt water.
7. Prepare your noodles according to packet instructions, and toast your sesame seeds.
8. To finish the broth, squeeze in the juice of a lime, add the miso paste, stirring to dissolve, then check the seasoning, adding more salt or a touch of sugar if required.
9. To serve, place the noodles into a deep bowl. Ladle over lots of broth, then top with the mushrooms, broccoli, spring onion greens, sesame seeds, a lime wedge + chilli oil if you like - enjoy!

You can also add enoki ramen topping (refer to our recipe) for mushroom replacement.
