Asian Buttermilk Sauce (Daun Kari)

Ingredients:
    •    30g butter (about 2 tbsp)
    •    2-3 cloves garlic, minced
    •    2 bird’s eye chilies (cili padi), chopped (adjust to spice preference)
    •    10-12 curry leaves (or substitute, see below)
    •    120ml evaporated milk (or fresh milk)
    •    60ml buttermilk (or mix 60ml milk with ½ tsp vinegar)
    •    15ml condensed milk (adjust for sweetness)
    •    ½ tsp salt (adjust to taste)
    •    ½ tsp chicken powder (optional, for extra umami)

If you don’t have curry leaves, here are some substitutes:

Best Substitutes for Curry Leaves in Buttermilk Sauce:
    1.    Lime zest + basil – Use a mix of lime zest (for citrus notes) and fresh basil (for mild sweetness).
    2.    Kaffir lime leaves – If available, use 1-2 torn kaffir lime leaves for a citrusy aroma.
    3.    Bay leaf + lime zest – A bay leaf adds a mild herbal note, while lime zest brings freshness.
    4.    Pandan leaf (screwpine leaf) – If you want a slightly floral and sweet touch, try a small piece of pandan leaf.
    5.    Lemongrass – Lightly bruise a small piece of lemongrass stalk for a mild citrusy replacement.
