If you use a plastic piping bag, wait for the dough to cool a bit and then double up the piping bag. 

Ingredients

- 250ml water
- 60g unsalted butter
- 1/2 tsp vanilla paste
- 115g caster sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 140g flour 
- 1 egg 
- 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 180g dark chocolate
- 150ml cream
- Oil for frying

Method

1. Start by adding the water, butter, vanilla, salt and 15g of sugar to a small pot and place on med-high heat.
2. When the water just starts to boil, add the flour and whisk. Cook this for 4-5 minutes on low, whisking the whole time.
3. Turn the heat off and let the dough cool for 5 minutes.
4. Add the egg and beat it in well until smooth. Place into a piping bag (note the plastic ones are not normally strong enough, so use at your own risk).
5. Add the rest of the sugar and the cinnamon to a shallow bowl and mix, set aside for the churros to go into after frying.
6. For the chocolate sauce, simply add the chocolate and cream to a bowl over a pot of boiling water and whisk until smooth.
7. To fry the doughnuts, heat the oil to 160Â°c and carefully pipe 10-12cm long pieces of batter into the hot oil.
8. Fry until golden brown on both sides.
9. Removed from the oil and once drained, dust in the cinnamon sugar.
10. Serve with the sauce and enjoy!
