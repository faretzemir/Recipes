Name=Potato Stuffed Tofu Snack (Taufu  Sumbat my way)

**Ingredients**
- 400g round fried tofu CF brand
- x3 holland potatotes (medium sized)
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste
- White Pepper to taste
- Asian cocaine (MSG) to taste
- 100g Carrots diced
- x1 shallot diced
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- 0.5 inches ginger minced
- x1 egg yolk
- 1 tbsp Sesame oil 
- White part of spring onion
- Cornstarch, just enough to bind everything together

1. Peel, cut and boil the potatoes until you forget that they’re on the stove (8-10 mins). Mash them up in a mixing bowl. 
2. Sauté carrots, garlic, shallot, ginger in oil. Pour hot oil into the mixing bowl onto the potatoes and then mix. 
3. Add salt, pepper, white pepper, cocaine, sesame oil, egg yolk and then mix. Add the cornstarch after just enough to bind everything a bit better. 
4. Prepare the tofu by cutting an X shape on their tops using a pair of kitchen shears. Take out the excess tofu inside to hollow it out. Mix that with the potato mix: don’t waste it!
5. Either fry now or refrigerate to fry another time. Fry with the x shape down first and finish the other sides.
