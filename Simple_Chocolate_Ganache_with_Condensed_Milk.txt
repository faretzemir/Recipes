Name=Simple Chocolate Ganache with Condensed Milk

Ingredients:
    •    200g chocolate (dark, milk, or semi-sweet)
    •    150g sweetened condensed milk

Instructions:
    1.    Chop the chocolate into small pieces for even melting.
    2.    Heat the condensed milk in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Do not let it boil.
    3.    Add the chopped chocolate and stir until smooth and fully melted.
    4.    Remove from heat and let it cool slightly before using.

This ganache will be thicker than one made with heavy cream. If you need a thinner consistency, you can add a small amount of warm milk or butter. It works well for drizzling, spreading, or as a filling but may not have the same fluidity as traditional ganache.

!! You can also chill this in the fridge for a few hours and then you can use this to make chocolate truffles. !!
