Name=Fried Chicken Recipe

Naddy got this off of Youtube, I edited this to add some spices from a version of this I did when I was 16. The brining best practices would be to wait overnight in the fridge, but as usual, just do it until you lose patience.


Ingredients:

- Chicken (we like the dark meat, but you can use breast, fillet, etc, if you wanna do a whole chicken this way also be my guest)

Brine
- Buttermilk (Mix milk and vinegar or lime or lemon juice, get it to curdle a bit before stirring) You want enough of this to cover the chicken.
- Salt (Plenty of salt - like 10 cracks of it / 5-6 tbsp)
- Pepper to taste
- Cumin 1/2 tsp
- Coriander powder 1/2 tsp
- Garlic powder 1/2 tsp
- Carbonara buldak sauce, sambal or any hot sauce available

The Bourgeois Brine (optional)
Add the following:
- 2-3 Bay Leaves
- Partially cracked or whole black peppercorns
- Olive or avocado oil

Flour Coating
- AP Flour (agak agak)
- salt to taste (remember, we brined this already - not too much)
- Pepper to taste
- Cumin 1/2 tsp
- Coriander powder 1/2 tsp
- Garlic powder 1/2 tsp

- Oil for frying


Instructions:
1. Brine the chicken in a bowl, ideally overnight or until you lose patience.
2. Mix the flour coating in a separate bowl, prepare right before you want to fry.
3. Take the chicken, not sopping wet, but slightly dripping and dredge it in the flour. Do these one by one, make sure each and every piece is coated evenly and throughout. No wet spots - all have to have flour.
4. You can arrange these nicely somewhere while you heat up the oil. Medium high heat - Induction level 6 or default heat.
5. Fry in small batches. If you cannot deep fry, then make sure to baste the chicken with oil to cook the top that sticks out of the oil. Fry each piece till golden brown. Put on rack lined with paper towels to absorb oil.
6. Serve hot.
