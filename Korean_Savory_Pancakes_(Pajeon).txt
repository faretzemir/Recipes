Name=Korean Savory Pancakes (Pajeon)

Crispy and savory, perfect as a side dish or snack.

Ingredients:
    •    150g enoki mushrooms
    •    ½ cup all-purpose flour (or rice flour for a crispier texture)
    •    ¼ cup water
    •    1 egg
    •    ½ tsp salt
    •    ¼ cup chopped scallions (or ¼ cup chopped kimchi for a kimchi version)
    •    1 tbsp oil for frying

Dipping Sauce (Optional):
    •    2 tbsp soy sauce
    •    1 tbsp vinegar
    •    ½ tsp sesame oil

Instructions:
    1.    Trim and separate the enoki mushrooms into small bundles.
    2.    In a bowl, mix flour, water, egg, and salt to create a pancake batter. Stir in the enoki and scallions (or kimchi).
    3.    Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Scoop small portions of the batter onto the pan, flattening slightly.
    4.    Cook for about 3 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy.
    5.    Mix dipping sauce ingredients and serve with the pancakes.

Notes: Can just use whatever leftover tempura or other batter to make the pancake mix
