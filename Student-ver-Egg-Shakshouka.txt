Ingredients
- [ ] Cheap shit pasta sauce
- [ ] Cheap AF beans in tomato sauce / or chickpeas in brine (half can if chickpeas, whole small can if buying beans)
- [ ] Small can of cheap AF tomato purée (optional) or a small squeeze of tomato purée tube
- [ ] 3 onions; 1 large 2 small, chop in any way you like
- [ ] 4-6 cloves of garlic, minced
- [ ] Salt, pepper, spice element (this can be anything spicy you have on hand. Cayenne, paprika, chilli flakes, etc.)
- [ ] Corn starch to make a slurry
- [ ] Olive oil
- [ ] 4 large eggs, or whatever size you can afford
- [ ] Bread for toast points
- [ ] Butter

Instructions 

*If using chickpeas, drain all the brine. We won’t need it. 

*If using beans in tomato sauce, add the whole thing. 

1. Heat up a pan over medium high heat with some olive oil in it. Add the onions and cook until very tender, almost caramelised. Reduce heat to low after. 
2. Add the garlic and mix to combine until the flavours get to know each other. 
3. Toss in the pasta sauce, beans/chickpeas and tomato purée. Break the beans down into small, chuffed to bits bits. 
4. Add corn starch slurry and then let reduce to about 1/2 volume or until thicc. 
5. Add salt, pepper and spice element to taste. 
6. Create a well in the sauce to dump an egg into. Try not to break the yolk. Repeat for three more eggs. 
7. Cover the pan with whatever you have to cover the pan with. I use aluminium foil since those fancy IKEA silicon covers are expensive. Cook the eggs but make sure the yolks are still runny. 
8. Make toast points to dip into the egg yolks. If you have a toaster just do it like that, if not then use a different pan with bread and butter. 
9. Serve in the pan. 

Notes
*If you are poor like I was, and you only have 1 pan, then do step 6 before step 1.
