Name=Garlic Egg Fried Rice

Ingredients
- [ ] Old refrigerated rice (1 day or 1 week)
- [ ] 2-3 fresh eggs, beaten, salted, peppered and preferably with some mayonnaise or cooking cream added into the mixture
- [ ] Oyster sauce to taste 
- [ ] Soy sauce (thicc sauce like Kecap Bango) to taste but not too much as it changes the colour of the rice
- [ ] 1 small onion, diced
- [ ] 4-6 cloves of garlic, minced 
- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste
- [ ] Monosodium glutamate, AKA Asian cocaine, to taste
- [ ] Spring onions to mix in and garnish

Instructions
1. Add oil to a wok/large pan until it is smoking. 
2. Working quickly, add the eggs to the pan and make rough scrambled eggs (don’t make them Gordon Ramsey style, make them into ribbon-like shapes), but don’t cook them all the way through. Set aside in the same bowl used for the egg mixture previously. 
3. Add a bit more oil to the pan/wok and then add in the onion, cooking until translucent, then add the garlic, and then add in the rice and toss to combine. 
4. Add the semi-cooked egg and stir everything to combine. 
5. Add oyster sauce, kecap bango, Asian cocaine, salt and pepper to taste. 
6. Mix in the spring onions, top and serve

*For better rice, spread rice evenly onto a tray to break up clumps before cooking. 

*To make nasi goreng belacan, add in belacan paste sometime in step 3.
