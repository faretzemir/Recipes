Name=Japanese Fried Rice for Omurice

This is a very simple ketchup fried rice that the Japanese people like to make for omurice.

Ingredients:
- Refrigerated rice
- Carrot, diced 1 cup
- 1/2 medium onion or 1 large shallot, diced
- 2-3 cloves garlic minced
- Chicken, cubed 100g
- Cumin 1/2 tsp for the chicken
- Ketchup or chili sauce 2-3 Tbsp
- Oyster sauce 1 tbsp (my own addition), traditionally no need
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste
- Oil 2 tbsp

Instructions:
1. Fry off the carrot, onion and garlic until the flavors get to know each other.
2. Add in the chicken and cumin, cook until the chicken is 80% done. We will get the chicken to finish with the rice so that its not overcooked.
3. Add in the rice, ketchup, oyster sauce, salt and pepper and mix everything until the rice is fully coated with ketchup. The rice should be red at this point.
4. Serve hot. Can top with spring onions if you want.
