Name=Tofu Pad Krapow

Ingredients
- [ ] Tofu, 3 small blocks, dried as much as possible
- [ ] ~200g Thai basil (thai holy basil??)
- [ ] 3-4 Cili padi / thai chilli
- [ ] 4 cloves of garlic
- [ ] 5-6 Long bean / French beans, chopped
- [ ] Egg (depends on how many people are eating)
- [ ] White Rice, just use the rice cooker. 

Sauce

*Note: the best way to make this sauce is just to eye the ingredients. Who the fuck measures this out anyway. Disgrace to Asian culture. 

Mix this all together. 

- [ ] 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce
- [ ] 1 Tbsp light (sweet) soy sauce
- [ ] 1 Tbsp fish sauce
- [ ] 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- [ ] 2 Tbsp water

Steps
1. Dry out the tofu as much as you can. Stick it in the oven if you have to. 180C for 10-15 minutes should do the trick. 
2. Traditionally, in a pestle and mortar, smash together the Thai chilli and garlic. Alternatively, if don‚Äôt have Thai chilli, just use red belacan paste. Basically tastes the same. 
3. In a large pan or wok, saut√© the chilli and garlic mix, until fragrant. 
4. Crumble the tofu up in your hands, and into the pan. Mix it up until the flavours get to know each other. 
5. Add the sauce mix to the pan, mix with everything else. 
6. Add the French beans, then cook for a few minutes. 
7. At the very end, add the Thai basil until barely wilted. Set aside. 
8. Fry one egg for each person eating. 
9. Serve the pad Krapow on hot white rice, top with the fried egg. 

Instead of Thai Chilli, I used belacan paste (already incorporates Thai chillies as well as garlic inside)

You can substitute the protein for anything you want, beef, chicken, pork, tofu, anything that has meat is ok üëçüèª
