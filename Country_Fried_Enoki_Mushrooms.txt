Name=Country Fried Enoki Mushrooms

This is a side dish. We usually eat this with the sauce made using a mix of ketchup or garlic chili, honey, gochujang and kewpie mayonnaise.

Ingredients:
- Enoki Mushrooms
- 3 Heaping Tbsp AP Flour
- 3 Heaping Tbsp Cornstarch
- MSG 2Tbsp
- Salt 2 cracks
- Pepper 2 cracks
- Zed's Dad's spice mix 1Tbsp (if on hand, if not then just the rest of the spices)
- Coriander Powder 1/2 tsp
- Cumin 1/2 tsp
- Garlic Powder 1/2 tsp
- Paprika 1/2 tsp
- Chili Flakes (as much as you want, but be realistic)
- Frying oil

Instructions:
1. Cut the enoki mushrooms into small bunches (not too thick, not too thin).
2. Mix the rest of the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add enough water so that it's a slightly viscous liquid. Not too thick and not too thin. This is the batter.
3. Dunk the mushrooms in the batter, but make sure its not dripping when you put it in the oil.
4. Heat the oil on medium heat (induction level 6 / default temp)
5. Fry until golden brown. Let cool and dry on a rack lined with paper towels to absorb the oil.
6. Serve with the signature sauce.
