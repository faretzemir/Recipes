# faretzandnaddy-recipes
This repo is for me to dump cooking recipes that I made with my wife, Naddy when we were students. 
Generally, the recipes in this online cookbook make 2 Pax, but just sort of guess the quantity of the carbohydrate of the dish for the amount of people you are planning to feed.  <br>

The recipes in this repo are divided by type, such as mains, desserts, snacks, etc. Switch branches in order to view different recipes.
