Instructions 

While the pasta is cooking, continue to step 2

1. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta accordingly. We usually suggest Al-dentist since the pasta will continue cooking later on the skillet. Reserve some pasta water and drain the rest. 
2. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and grated Parmesan or whatever block of shitty cheese you can get. Set this aside. 
3. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the strips of cut dubious beef and cook until brown and crispy (about 6-8 mins), then set aside. Leave excess fat on the pan. 
4. In the same pan, stir in the garlic until the flavours get to know each other (about 1 min or less). Reduce heat to low. 
5. Add a reasonable, Asian person amount of butter and flour to make the roux. Stir until roux-ey. There does not need to be much roux, only enough to kick start the sauce. 
6. Working quickly, stir in the pasta first. 
7. TURN OFF the heat, then add the egg mixture and gently toss to combine. Season with salt, pepper and cayenne/paprika to taste. 
8. Add reserved pasta water until desired consistency is achieved. 
9. Top with crispy beef bits saved from step 3. 
10. Serve immediately, and garnish with basil and more grated Parmesan.
