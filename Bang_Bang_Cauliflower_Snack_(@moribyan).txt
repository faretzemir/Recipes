Ingredients

For the Bang Bang Sauce:
    •    ½ cup mayonnaise
    •    ½ cup sweet chili sauce
    •    1 teaspoon minced garlic
    •    1 tablespoon rice vinegar
    •    1 tablespoon sriracha (adjust to taste)
    •    ½ tablespoon fresh parsley, finely chopped

For the Cauliflower and Batter:
    •    1 head cauliflower, florets separated
    •    1¼ cups buttermilk
    •    ⅓ cup cornstarch
    •    ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
    •    2 teaspoons chili powder
    •    1 teaspoon garlic powder
    •    ½ teaspoon paprika
    •    1 teaspoon salt
    •    ½ teaspoon black pepper
    •    ⅓ cup panko breadcrumbs

Instructions
    1.    Preheat Oven: Set your oven to 450°F (230°C).
    2.    Prepare the Bang Bang Sauce: In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, minced garlic, rice vinegar, sriracha, and chopped parsley until smooth. Set aside.
    3.    Make the Batter: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, cornstarch, all-purpose flour, chili powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper until a thick batter forms.
    4.    Coat the Cauliflower: Add the cauliflower florets to the batter, ensuring each piece is evenly coated. Sprinkle in the panko breadcrumbs and mix gently.
    5.    Bake: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the coated cauliflower florets in a single layer, ensuring they’re not touching. Bake for 20 minutes, then flip each piece and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until golden and crispy.
    6.    Sauce the Cauliflower: Once baked, transfer the cauliflower to a large bowl. Drizzle with the prepared bang bang sauce and toss to coat evenly. For a crispier texture, serve the sauce on the side as a dip.
    7.    Serve: Garnish with sliced green onions or additional parsley, if desired. Enjoy immediately.
