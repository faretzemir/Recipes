Serves: 2 
Prep time: 20min 
Cook time: 10 min

Ingredients
- 2 eggs, split into whites and yolks
- 20ml milk
- 30g flour
- a dash of vanilla extract
- 25g caster sugar
- butter and maple syrup to serve

Method
1. In a bowl, whisk egg whites until they form stiff peaks, then whisk in the caster sugar until smooth.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together egg yolks, milk, flour and vanilla extract until a smooth batter forms.
3. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter until just combined.
4. Place a frying pan (you have the lid for) on low heat.
5. Add the batter to a piping bag, lightly grease the pan and then pipe the batter into the pan. Add a very small amount of water to the pan and cover with a lid.
6. Cook for 5 minutes on very low, and then flip and repeat, adding the water again then the lid and cook for another 5 minutes.
7. Remove from the pan and serve with butter and maple syrup.

I had some better attempts at doing this with my steam convection oven, doing the pancakes on a tray and then flipping them, but I think people who are better than me at cooking will be able to do it in the pan. - Faretz
