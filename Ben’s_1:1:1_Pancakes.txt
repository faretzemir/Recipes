Name=Ben’s 1:1:1 Pancakes

Ingredients:
    •    100 grams eggs (approximately 2 large eggs)
    •    100 grams milk
    •    100 grams all-purpose flour
    •    A pinch of salt
- a pinch of baking soda
    •    Butter or oil for cooking

Instructions:
    1.    Prepare the Batter:
    •    In a bowl, whisk the eggs until well beaten.
    •    Add the milk to the eggs and mix thoroughly.
    •    Gradually sift in the flour and a pinch of salt, whisking continuously to form a smooth batter.
    2.    Rest the Batter:
    •    Let the batter rest for about 15 minutes. This allows the flour to hydrate and results in better texture.
    3.    Cook the Pancakes:
    •    Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.
    •    Pour a small amount of batter into the pan, tilting it to spread the batter evenly for thin pancakes.
    •    Cook for about 1-2 minutes until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set.
    •    Flip the pancake and cook for another minute until golden brown.
    4.    Serve:
    •    Serve warm with your favorite toppings such as syrup, fruits, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

This 1:1:1 ratio makes it easy to scale the recipe up or down based on your needs. Some users have noted that this ratio can produce a batter that yields pancakes with a slightly eggy taste. If you prefer a less pronounced egg flavor, you might consider adjusting the ratio slightly, such as increasing the amount of milk or flour. Feel free to experiment to find the balance that suits your taste.
