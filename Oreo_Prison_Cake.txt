Name=Oreo Prison Cake

Top this off with chocolate ganache (refer to our recipe)

Ingredients:
- 28 Oreos
- 250 ml Milk
- 1 tsp baking powder

Instructions:
1. Separate the oreo filling with the oreo cookie. Don't ask why - just do it apparently.
2. Crush the oreo cookies (we used a food chopper) into a fine powder. If you are too poor for a food chopper,  then put the cookies into a bag and then crush with whatever you have at your disposal.
3. Put the oreo powder into a bowl with the baking powder and mix to combine.
4. Add in the milk and oreo filling and mix until a batter forms. Pour into a greased bread tin.


Oven:
5. Preheat your oven to 180 Celsius.
6. Put the cake in and cover the bread tin with foil to steam everything.
7. Bake for about 30-35 mins. (in my experience) Can check at 20 mins if a toothpick or knife comes out clean or with a few crumbs then its done. Remember, there are no raw ingredients in this so technically it's safe to straight up drink the batter. As long as the thing is set you're good to go!
8. Let cool slightly and then cover in chocolate ganache (can refer to our recipe). Best eaten both ways: chilled or warm out of the oven.
