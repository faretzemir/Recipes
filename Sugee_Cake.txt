Name=Sugee Cake

This is a semolina cake recipe from a collection of handwritten recipes from Faretz’s grandmother. 

Ingredients:
    •    7 egg yolks
    •    3 egg whites
    •    10 oz sugar
    •    8 oz suji (semolina)
    •    12 oz butter
    •    4 oz self-raising flour
(if none, plain flour + 1 teaspoon baking powder)
    •    6 oz almonds

Method:
    1.    Beat butter, add sugar
(keep aside 3 oz sugar when beating egg whites—add sugar slowly so it will be stiff).
    2.    When butter is creamy, put egg yolks one by one, then save beaten egg whites.
    3.    Then fold in flour, egg whites, almonds, essence of vanilla, then brandy.
    4.    Heat oven for 18 minutes.
    5.    Oven 160° – 50/60 minutes
