Name=Creamy Chicken and Rice 

(Serves 2)

Ingredients:
    •    1 chicken breast (cut into bite-sized pieces)
    •    1 cup cooked white rice
    •    1/2 cup milk (or unsweetened oat/soy milk for dairy-free)
    •    1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
    •    1/2 small onion (finely chopped, optional if your tummy is very sensitive)
    •    1 clove garlic (minced, optional)
    •    1/2 tbsp butter (or olive oil for dairy-free)
    •    1 tsp cornstarch mixed with 1 tbsp water (for thickening)
    •    Salt to taste
    •    Cumin 1/2 tsp
    •    Coriander Powder
    •    Garlic Powder
    •    Chili Flakes (optional, for spice)
    •    Optional: A few cooked carrots or soft peas for a little color

Instructions:
    1.    Cook the chicken:
    •    Heat butter (or oil) in a pan over medium-low heat.
    •    Add the chicken and cook until no longer pink. If using onion and garlic, add them now and sauté until soft.
    2.    Make the sauce:
    •    Pour in the chicken broth, milk and toss in the spices. Stir well. 
    •    Let it simmer for 3–5 minutes until the chicken is tender.
    3.    Thicken the sauce:
    •    Stir in the cornstarch mixture and keep stirring until the sauce thickens slightly.
    4.    Combine with rice (optional, or serve separately):
    •    Add the cooked rice and mix well, letting it soak up the creamy sauce.
    5.    Final seasoning:
    •    Add a small pinch of salt to taste.
    •    If using soft vegetables, stir them in at the end.
    6.    Serve warm and enjoy!
