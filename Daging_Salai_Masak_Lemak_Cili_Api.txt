Ingredients:
    •    300g daging salai (smoked beef), sliced
    •    200ml thick coconut milk
    •    400ml water
    •    5-7 bird’s eye chilies (cili api) (adjust to taste)
    •    3 shallots
    •    2 cloves garlic
    •    1-inch piece turmeric root (kunyit hidup) (or 1 tsp turmeric powder)
    •    1 stalk lemongrass (serai), bruised
    •    1 bunga kantan (torch ginger flower), halved or quartered
    •    2 kaffir lime leaves (optional)
    •    1 piece asam keping (dried tamarind slice)
    •    Salt and sugar to taste

Instructions:
    1.    Prepare the spice paste: Blend or pound together the chilies, shallots, garlic, and turmeric root until smooth.
    2.    Cook the smoked beef: In a pot, add the daging salai and water. Simmer for about 10 minutes to tenderize the meat.
    3.    Add the aromatics: Stir in the blended spice paste, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves. Let it simmer for another 5 minutes until fragrant.
    4.    Pour in the coconut milk: Lower the heat and add the coconut milk, bunga kantan, and asam keping. Stir well to prevent curdling.
    5.    Season and simmer: Add salt and a pinch of sugar to taste. Let it cook for another 5-10 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally.
    6.    Serve: Once the gravy thickens slightly and the flavors are well combined, remove from heat. Serve hot with steamed rice.
