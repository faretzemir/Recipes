Steps
1.    heat butter in a saucepan on low heat until browned. remove from stove and add sugar and brown sugar.
2.    add egg and vanilla.
3.    sift flour and baking soda in, then gently fold until combined.
4.    add dark chocolate (chopped roughly) and save a little for adding onto the cookies before baking later. 
5. Chill dough for 60 minutes, then leave out for about 10 minutes before baking. 
6.    Scoop dough onto baking sheet. 
7. preheat oven to 175 —> 180 degrees Celsius, then bake for 12-14 minutes —> 15 minutes MAX (for our oven about 15-16 minutes) until edges are sliahtlv browned.
8. sprinkle with flaky salt and let rest to harden. THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT. 
9. If you have another batch to do, use a different tray. 
10. Serve warm

For chewier cookies, take them out when they are still a bit soft. They will harden a little out of the oven. The tip is to check when the edges of the cookies are hardened. Take them out then. 

Different ovens will bake things differently. For our oven, I had to adjust the temp and time to 180C for 19 minutes and I ended up baking the first batch for too long.

The first time I ended up with (14 mins + 8 mins), which left me with cookies that were hard except a little in the centre. The second time, I started with (14 + 8) then I subtracted 3 and then later added 2 when my cookies were still too soft. I ended up with 21 minutes as the perfect amount of time. 

Actually the original recipe was right and you have to let the cookies cool down as they will continue baking out of the oven and harden. Don’t be like me and let it get too hard. 

If you are unsure how your oven will fare, bake one test cookie and see how it turns out. Don’t be like me and bake the first batch of six in one go.
